    <h3 class="About-1">About Me</h3>
    <p class="About-2"> You might see me gaming, drawing, coding, or spending time with my family enjoying - quality time.<br> In addition, you will see me writing new website ideas. 
    My desire to begin learning and mastering web development<br> initially began in high school thanks to my teacher Mr. Storm who helped me gain the confidence to go beyond a classroom setting.
